# Cosmic Energy Grid Management (CEGM)

## Overview

The Cosmic Energy Grid Management (CEGM) system is a revolutionary framework designed to harness, distribute, and regulate energy across vast cosmic distances. By leveraging advanced astrophysics principles, quantum field manipulation, and gravitational wave technology, CEGM establishes the first interstellar energy network capable of capturing, transferring, and balancing power sources throughout the galaxy and beyond. This infrastructure enables civilizations to share energy resources efficiently across light-years, fundamentally transforming how intelligent species access and utilize the universe's abundant energy potential.
